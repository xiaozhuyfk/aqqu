Our existence deprives us of the minimum of physical activity essential for healthy living.", "When we got into office, the thing that surprised me most was to find that things were just as bad as we'd been saying they were.", "The great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie -- deliberate, contrived, and dishonest -- but the myth -- persistent, persuasive, and unrealistic.", "And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country. My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what, together, we can do for the freedom of man.", "For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed.", "Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans.", "Let us never negotiate out of fear but let us never fear to negotiate.", "If we cannot end our differences at least we can make the world safe for diversity.", "In giving rights to others which belong to them, we give rights to ourselves and to our country.", "A young man who does not have what it takes to perform military service is not likely to have what it takes to make a living.", "I dont think that unless a greater effort is made by the Government to win popular support that the war can be won out there. In the final analysis, it is their war. They are the ones who have to win it or lose it. We can help them, we can give them equipment, we can send our men out there as advisers, but they have to win it, the people of Viet-Nam, against the Communists.", "As they say on my own Cape Cod, a rising tide lifts all the boats. And a partnership, by definition, serves both partners, without domination or unfair advantage. Together we have been partners in adversitylet us also be partners in prosperity.", "In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibilityI welcome it.", "This increase in the life span and in the number of our senior citizens presents this Nation with increased opportunities: the opportunity to draw upon their skill and sagacityand the opportunity to provide the respect and recognition they have earned. It is not enough for a great nation merely to have added new years to lifeour objective must also be to add new life to those years.", "It is our task in our time and in our generation to hand down undiminished to those who come after us, as was handed down to us by those who went before, the natural wealth and beauty which is ours.", "The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve itand the glow from that fire can truly light the world.", "Of course, both major parties today seek to serve the national interest. They would do so in order to obtain the broadest base of support, if for no nobler reason. But when party and officeholder differ as to how the national interest is to be served, we must place first the responsibility we owe not to our party or even to our constituents but to our individual consciences.", "To further the appreciation of culture among all the people, to increase respect for the creative individual, to widen participation by all the processes and fulfillments of artthis is one of the fascinating challenges of these days.", "We believe that if men have the talent to invent new machines that put men out of work, they have the talent to put those men back to work.", "Many years ago the great British explorer George Mallory, who was to die on Mount Everest, was asked why did he want to climb it. He said Because it is there. Well, space is there, and were going to climb it, and the moon and the planets are there, and new hopes for knowledge and peace are there.", "There is a connection, hard to explain logically but easy to feel, between achievement in public life and progress in the arts. The age of Pericles was also the age of Phidias. The age of Lorenzo de Medici was also the age of Leonardo da Vinci. The age of Elizabeth was also the age of Shakespeare. And the New Frontier for which I campaign in public life, can also be a New Frontier for American art.", "The purpose of foreign policy is not to provide an outlet for our own sentiments of hope or indignation; it is to shape real events in a real world.", "I ask that you offer to the political arena, and to the critical problems of our society which are decided therein, the benefit of the talents which society has helped to develop in you. I ask you to decide, as Goethe put it, whether you will be an anvilor a hammer. The question is whether you are to be a hammerwhether you are to give to the world in which you were reared and educated the broadest possible benefits of that education.", "This country cannot afford to be materially rich and spiritually poor.", "We cannot expect that everyone, to use the phrase of a decade ago, will talk sense to the American people. But we can hope that fewer people will listen to nonsense. And the notion that this Nation is headed for defeat through deficit, or that strength is but a matter of slogans, is nothing but just plain nonsense.", "Sometimes party loyalty asks too much.", "Now the trumpet summons us againnot as a call to bear arms, though arms we neednot as a call to battle, though embattled we arebut a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulationa struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself.", "We in this country, in this generation, areby destiny rather than choicethe watchmen on the walls of world freedom. We ask, therefore, that we may be worthy of our power and responsibility, that we may exercise our strength with wisdom and restraint, and that we may achieve in our time and for all time the ancient vision of peace on earth, good will toward men. That must always be our goal, and the righteousness of our cause must always underlie our strength. For as was written long ago: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.", "There is always inequity in life. Some men are killed in a war and some men are wounded, and some men never leave the country, and some men are stationed in the Antarctic and some are stationed in San Francisco. Its very hard in military or in personal life to assure complete equality. Life is unfair.", "If this nation is to be wise as well as strong, if we are to achieve our destiny, then we need more new ideas for more wise men reading more good books in more public libraries. These libraries should be open to allexcept the censor. We must know all the facts and hear all the alternatives and listen to all the criticisms. Let us welcome controversial books and controversial authors. For the Bill of Rights is the guardian of our security as well as our liberty.", "I am deeply touchednot as deeply touched as you have been coming to this dinner, but nevertheless it is a sentimental occasion.", "We must use time as a tool, not as a couch.", "Somebody once said that Washington was a city of Northern charm and Southern efficiency.", "War will exist until that distant day when the conscientious objector enjoys the same reputation and prestige that the warrior does today.", "It might be said now that I have the best of both worlds: a Harvard education and a Yale degree.", "I do not think it altogether inappropriate to introduce myself to this audience. I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris, and I have enjoyed it.", "Well, I am reading more and enjoying it less[laughter]and so on, but I have not complained nor do I plan to make any general complaints. I read and talk to myself about it, but I dont plan to issue any general statement on the press. I think that they are doing their task, as a critical branch, the fourth estate. And I am attempting to do mine. And we are going to live together for a period, and then go our separate ways. [Laughter].", "First, I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth. I believe we should go to the moon. But there is no sense in agreeing or desiring that the United States take an affirmative position in outer space, unless we are prepared to do the work and bear the burdens to make it successful.", "Theres an old saying that victory has 100 fathers and defeat is an orphan."]

History furnishes one example only of a first magistrate being formally brought to public justice. Every body cried out against this as unconstitutional. What was the practice before this, in cases where the chief magistrate rendered himself obnoxious? Why, recourse was had to assassination, in which he was not only deprived of his life, but of the opportunity of vindicating his character.

At length it was suspected that the stadtholder was at the bottom of the matter. This suspicion prevailed more and more. Yet, as he could not be impeached, and no regular examination took place, he remained in his office; and strengthening his own party, as the party opposed to him became formidable, he gave birth to the most violent animosities and contentions.

Roosevelt urging that research be funded for an atomic bomb on the grounds that the United States had to possess the weapon before Germany.", "This recommendation marked the beginning of the Manhattan Project for the construction of the world's first nuclear weapons, although it was such scientists as Fermi rather than Einstein himself (considered a security risk, in spite of  becoming a U.S. citizen in 1940) who led and participated in the project.", "After World War II and the bombing of Japan, Einstein became an ardent supporter of nuclear disarmament, while also campaigning for the establishment of a world government and of an independent Jewish state.", "The first was the explanation of an anomaly in the orbit of the planet Mercury (that its perihelion, or point of orbit closest to the Sun, advanced slightly more than was predicted by Newton's laws) that could not be explained by Newtonian mechanics.", "The second was that a red shift (i.e. to a longer wavelength) is produced if light passes through an intense gravitational field (this was subsequently detected in astronomical observations by the English astronomer Arthur Eddington in 1924).", "He also found that in a system in motion relative to an observer,  not only would length be observed to decrease, but time would slow and mass would increase.", "Einstein's theory was revolutionary because previously scientists had believed that basic quantities of measurement such as time, mass, and length were absolute and unchanging, while his work established the opposite notion - that these measurements could change, depending on the relative motion of the observer.", "In 1913, Einstein was made director of scientific research at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics in Berlin and given a chair in physics  at the University of Berlin, where he became the colleague of, among others, Planck, Nernst, and later Schrodinger.", "In order to solve this problem, Einstein - using the quantum hypothesis (1900) of the German physicist Planck - postulated that light travels in tiny discrete bundles, or individual \"quanta\" of energy (later called photons), the energy of which is a function of its wavelength.", "He influenced Heaviside, and Wiener.", "He was influenced by Helmholtz.", "A precursor was JJ Thomson.", "In this work, Einstein showed that Newton's theory of gravitation is in fact a close approximation of his more exact general theory of relativity, but relegated it to a special case, only useful at relatively slow speeds.", "Einstein instead postulated that gravitation is not a force, as Newton had believed, but a curved field in the space-time continuum, created by the presence of mass, replacing Newton's theory of gravitational attraction between bodies by a space-time mathematical description in which bodies influence the characteristics of space in their vicinity.", "In addition to his continued work on the unified field theory, he was continually in demand as a speaker and during the 1930s he wrote extensively on many topics, especially peace.", "In 1939 he was informed by Niels Bohr that at Copenhagen the German refugee physicist Lise Meitner had split the uranium atom in experiments that had been inspired by similar, though less precise, experiments done months earlier in Berlin by two German chemists, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann.", "He met Eisenstein.", "He knew Rutherford.", "Wrote anti-war letter with Russell.", "As a result, Einstein concluded that no system can move at a velocity equal to or greater than the velocity of light.", "Einstein's conclusions regarding time dilation and mass increase were later verified with observations of fast-moving subatomic particles and cosmic rays, and no velocity greater than the speed of light has ever been detected.", "It had also proved impossible to measure the expected changes in the speed of light relative to the motion of the Earth, and in 1881 and 1887 the Michelson-Morley experiment had proved conclusively there was no 'ether,'  and  that the velocity of light does not vary with the motion of either the source or the observer.", "To account for  this, the Irish physicist George Francis FitzGerald, and the Dutch physicist Lorentz independently suggested that all lengths (of the stands,  for example,  holding the mirrors reflecting the light beam whose velocity through the 'ether' was being measured) contract in the direction of motion (the 'FitzGerald-Lorentz contraction'),  and had developed a mathematical formula to  describe the effect of motion on various types of measurement.", "One of his early followers was Laue.", "The first of these (\"On the Movement of Small Particles Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Demanded by the Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat\") dealt with a phenomenon first observed by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown in 1827, who reported that tiny particles, such as pollen grains, moved about with a rapid and random zigzag motion when suspended in liquid, and that the motion of the particles increased when the temperature increased, but that the motion decreased if larger particles were used.", "In addition to these three great achievements, Einstein wrote two more papers in 1905, one being his doctoral dissertation, and the other titled: \"Does the Inertia of a Body Depend on Its Energy Content?\" which again dealt with relativity and came to the conclusion that the energy and mass of a body are closely interrelated.", "Two years later, in 1907, he went on to show that mass is related to energy by the famous equation E=mc2 (energy equals mass times the speed of light squared), which indicates the enormous amount of energy that is stored as mass, some of which is released in radioactivity and nuclear reactions.", "Despite these achievements, when Einstein submitted his paper on relativity to the University of Berne in 1905 in support of his application to become a Privatdozent (unsalaried junior lecturer), his application was rejected and he continued at the Patent Office for another three years.", "So when light falls on a metal, electrons in the metal absorb specific quanta of energy, giving them enough energy to escape from the surface of the metal,  with the number of electrons released determined not by the number of quanta (i.e. the intensity) of the light, but by its energy (i.e. its wavelength).", "The same year,  in 'The Annals of Physics'  Einstein published three papers (on Brownian motion, the photoelectric effect, and special relativity) that not only established his genius as a theoretical physicist, but also changed both the face of physics and humanity's view of the universe.", "Einstein hypothesized that the visible motion of the particles was caused by the random movement of molecules that made up the liquid, and derived a mathematical formula that predicted the distance travelled by particles and their relative speed, from which the number of molecules of liquid per unit volume could be inferred.", "Einstein's work on Brownian motion is generally regarded as the first direct experimental evidence for the hypothesis that matter is composed of atoms and molecules.", "In 1908 his second application to Berne was accepted.", "He discovered the basic laser principle He was a friend of Lindemann.", "Einstein was triumphantly vindicated when observations of a solar eclipse in 1919 showed apparent shifts of exactly the amount he had predicted, and once this result was reported throughout the world Einstein became internationally famous, and relativity a household word.", "Einstein's publication of his \"Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity\" essentially brought to a close the revolutionary period of his scientific career.", "With the rise of National Socialism in Germany, Einstein's position as both a Jew and a pacifist became increasingly difficult, and with Hitler's rise to power in 1933 he accepted an appointment at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton, New Jersey, where he spent the rest of his life.", "During the 1920s, a period when Germany's political situation was deteriorating rapidly and anti-Semitism was on the rise, he instead became involved in anti-nationalist and pacifist causes, and began publicly to support the Zionist movement - all of which made him highly unpopular with Germany's growing right wing.", "He met composer Britten.", "In particular, he found it impossible to accept Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, central to quantum mechanics, which states that the movement of a single particle could not be predicted because of a fundamental uncertainty in measuring simultaneously both its speed and its position (which meant, in effect, that the future of any physical system at the subatomic level cannot be predicted).", "Believing in a God and an exactly engineered universe, at the Solvay Conference of 1927 on quantum theory attended by Planck, Bohr, de Broglie, Heisenberg, Schrodinger and Dirac among others - Einstein alienated many of his  colleagues by claiming that quantum mechanics, which could only calculate the probabilities of physical events, although brilliant could not be absolutely correct because \"God does not play dice\" with the universe.", "Instead, much to the dismay of the majority of his fellow scientists (in particular his close friend the German quantum theorist Born), Einstein devoted the remaining years of his life to the search for a unified field theory, a single mathematical theory that would encompass all physical fields, particularly gravitation and electromagnetism.", "In 1902, Einstein got a junior-level appointment at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern, working as an appraiser for new electrical machines,  and studying in his spare time for a doctorate from the University of Zurich,  which he achieved in 1905 for a paper titled:  \"A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions\".", "During the war years, Einstein became an outspoken opponent of German militarism, but remained primarily engaged in perfecting the extension of his 1905 theory of relativity to a broader context, by considering systems that are not in uniform motion but under acceleration.", "Now attempting to encompass all kinds of motion and accelerations (varying velocities), Einstein introduced the concept that it is not possible to distinguish being in a uniform gravitational field from moving under constant acceleration without gravitation and that therefore, in a general view of relativity, gravitation must be taken into account.", "He was painted by Rothenstein.", "Einstein's second paper (\"On a Heuristic Viewpoint Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light\") dealt with the photoelectric effect.", "First observed by Heinrich Hertz in 1888, the photoelectric effect involves the release of electrons from a metal that occurs when light is shone on the metal, the number of electrons released being a function not of the light's intensity (as one might expect) but of the color (i.e. the wavelength) of the light.", "The third test was Einstein's prediction that the apparent positions of stars would shift when they are seen near the Sun, because the Sun's intense gravity would bend the light rays from the stars as they pass the Sun (this starlight being visible only during a total eclipse).", "The magnitude of these effects is negligible at ordinary velocities, for which Newton's laws still held good, but at velocities approaching the speed of light they become significant.", "If a system were to move at the velocity of light, to an observer its length would be zero, time would be at a stop, and its mass would be infinite.", "In 1895 Einstein failed the  entrance examination for the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology  in Zurich, one of Europe's finest institutions for higher learning in science, where he had planned to major in electrical engineering.", "As a result he enrolled for a year at a Swiss cantonal high school.", "In 1952, after the death of Israel's first president, Chaim Weizmann, Einstein was invited to succeed him as president, but he declined as having a personality unsuited to politics."]

But can you tell me the name of a classical Greek shoemaker?", "Look, we're all the same; a man is a fourteen-room house --in the bedroom he's asleep with his intelligent wife, in the living-room he's rolling around with some bareass girl, in the library he's paying his taxes, in the yard he's raising tomatoes, and in the cellar he's making a bomb to blow it all up.", "A playwright is the litmus paper of the arts. He's got to be, because if he isn't working on the same wave length as the audience, no one would know what in hell he was talking about. He is a kind of psychic journalist, even when he's great.", "By whatever means it is accomplished, the prime business of a play is to arouse the passions of its audience so that by the route of passion may be opened up new relationships between a man and men, and between men and Man.

If only for this reason I regard the theater as a serious business, one that makes or should make man more human, which is to say, less alone.", "Without alienation, there can be no politics.", "He's not the finest character that ever lived. But he's a human being, and a terrible thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid.", "The closer a man approaches tragedy the more intense is his concentration of emotion upon the fixed point of his commitment, which is to say the closer he approaches what in life we call fanaticism.", "In the theater, while you recognized that you were looking at a house, it was a house in quotation marks. On screen, the quotation marks tend to be blotted out by the camera.", "If I have any justification for having lived it's simply, I'm nothing but faults, failures and so on, but I have tried to make a good pair of shoes. There's some value in that."]

what is james madison most famous for?	["President of the United States"]	["The free system of government we have established is so congenial with reason, with common sense, and with a universal feeling, that it must produce approbation and a desire of imitation, as avenues may be found for truth to the knowledge of nations.", "Learned Institutions ought to be favorite objects with every free people. They throw that light over the public mind which is the best security against crafty & dangerous encroachments on the public liberty.", "It is my good fortune, moreover, to have the path in which I am to tread lighted by examples of illustrious services successfully rendered in the most trying difficulties by those who have marched before me.", "War contains so much folly, as well as wickedness, that much is to be hoped from the progress of reason; and if any thing is to be hoped, every thing ought to be tried.", "A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.", "Learned Institutions ought to be favorite objects with every free people. They throw that light over the public mind which is the best security against crafty and dangerous encroachments on the public liberty.", "Since the general civilization of mankind, I believe there are more instances of the abridgment of the freedom of the people, by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power, than by violent and sudden usurpations.", "It will be of little avail to the people, that the laws are made by men of their own choice, if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood; if they be repealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is to-day, can guess what it will be to-morrow.", "I think it absolutely necessary that the President should have the power of removing [his subordinates] from office; it will make him, in a peculiar manner, responsible for their conduct, and subject him to impeachment himself, if he suffers them to perpetrate with impunity high crimes or misdemeanors against the United States, or neglects to superintend their conduct, so as to check their excesses.", "The constitution supposes, what the History of all Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of power most interested in war, & most prone to it. It has accordingly with studied care, vested the question of war in the Legislature. But the Doctrines lately advanced strike at the root of all these provisions, and will deposit the peace of the Country in that Department which the Constitution distrusts as most ready without cause to renounce it. For if the opinion of the President not the facts & proofs themselves are to sway the judgment of Congress, in declaring war, and if the President in the recess of Congress create a foreign mission, appoint the minister, & negociate a War Treaty, without the possibility of a check even from the Senate, untill the measures present alternatives overruling the freedom of its judgment; if again a Treaty when made obliges the Legislature to declare war contrary to its judgment, and in pursuance of the same doctrine, a law declaring war, imposes a like moral obligation, to grant the requisite supplies until it be formally repealed with the consent of the President & Senate, it is evident that the people are cheated out of the best ingredients in their Government, the safeguards of peace which is the greatest of their blessings.", "The happy Union of these States is a wonder; their Constitution a miracle; their example the hope of Liberty throughout the world.", "The genius of Republican liberty, seems to demand on one side, not only that all power should be derived from the people; but, that those entrusted with it should be kept in dependence on the people, by a short duration of their appointments; and, that, even during this short period, the trust should be placed not in a few, but in a number of hands. Stability, on the contrary, requires, that the hands, in which power is lodged, should continue for a length of time, the same. A frequent change of men will result from a frequent return of electors, and a frequent change of measures, from a frequent change of men; whilst energy in Government requires not only a certain duration of power, but the execution of it by a single hand.", "The danger of disturbing the public tranquillity by interesting too strongly the public passions, is a still more serious objection against a frequent reference of constitutional questions to the decision of the whole society.", "To the press alone, chequered as it is with abuses, the world is indebted for all the triumphs which have been gained by reason and humanity over error and oppression.", "The essence of Government is power; and power, lodged as it must be in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse.", "The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.", "In order to judge of the form to be given to this institution [the Senate], it will be proper to take a view of the ends to be served by it. These were,first, to protect the people against their rulers, secondly, to protect the people against the transient impressions into which they themselves might be led.", "...the aids which alone can supply my deficiencies is in the well-tried intelligence and virtue of my fellow-citizens...", "What spectacle can be more edifying or more seasonable, than that of Liberty & Learning, each leaning on the other for their mutual & surest support?", "The safety and happiness of society are the objects at which all political institutions aim, and to which all such institutions must be sacrificed.", "..to support the Constitution, which is the cement of the Union, as well in its limitations as in its authorities;", "About to add the solemnity of an oath to the obligations imposed by a second call to the station in which my country heretofore placed me, I find in the presence of this respectable assembly an opportunity of publicly repeating my profound sense of so distinguished a confidence and of the responsibility united with it.", "And as it [the federal district] is to be appropriated to this use with the consent of the State ceding it; as the State will no doubt provide in the compact for the rights, and the consent of the citizens inhabiting it; as the inhabitants will find sufficient inducements of interest to become willing parties to the cession; as they will have had their voice in the election of the Government which is to exercise authority over them; as a municipal Legislature for local purposes, derived from their own suffrages, will of course be allowed them; and as the authority of the Legislature of the State, and of the inhabitants of the ceded part of it, to concur in the cession, will be derived from the whole people of the State, in their adoption of the Constitution, every imaginable objection seems to be obviated.", "What is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.", "Liberty may be endangered by the abuse of liberty, but also by the abuse of power.", "We are right to take alarm at the first experiment upon our liberties.", "Is it not the glory of the people of America, that, whilst they have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times and other nations, they have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity, for custom, or for names, to overrule the suggestions of their own good sense, the knowledge of their own situation, and the lessons of their own experience? To this manly spirit, posterity will be indebted for the possession, and the world for the example, of the numerous innovations displayed on the American theatre, in favor of private rights and public happiness.", "As the war was just in its origin and necessary and noble in its objects, we can reflect with a proud satisfaction that in carrying it on no principle of justice or honor, no usage of civilized nations, no precept of courtesy or humanity, have been infringed.", "The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to an uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government.", "If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.", "The proposed Constitution is, in strictness, neither a national nor a federal constitution; but a composition of both.", "To cherish peace and friendly intercourse with all nations having correspondent dispositions; to maintain sincere neutrality toward belligerent nations; to prefer in all cases amicable discussion and reasonable accommodation of differences to a decision of them by an appeal to arms....", "As a man is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said to have a property in his rights.", "Equal laws protecting equal rights the best guarantee of loyalty & love of country."]

A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.  Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.  Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.", "Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.", "Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil. For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled. Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.", "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment: But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire. Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift. Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison. Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.", "Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. And if thy right hand offend thee, cut if off, and cast it from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.", "It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorcement: But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery.", "Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God\u2019s throne: Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.", "Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain. Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.", "Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy. But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you; That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust. For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even the publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so? Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.", "Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven. Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth: That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.", "And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him. After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.  Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.", "For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.", "Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.  Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.", "Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward. But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face; That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly."]
